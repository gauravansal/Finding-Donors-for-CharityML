## Project Overview<a name="overview"></a>

CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. After nearly 32,000 letters were sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. With nearly 15 million working Californians, CharityML has brought you on board to help build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead cost of sending mail. Our goal will be evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project is designed to get us acquainted with the many supervised learning algorithms available in sklearn, and to also provide for a method of evaluating just how each model works and performs on a certain type of data. It is important in machine learning to understand exactly when and where a certain algorithm should be used, and when one should be avoided.

In this project, we will apply supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. We will first explore the data to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, we will apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. We will then evaluate several supervised learners of our choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards, We will optimize the model that we have selected and present it as our solution to CharityML. Finally, We will explore the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.

## Installation<a name="installation"></a>

* Python 3.5+ (I used Python 3.6)
* Data Processing & Machine Learning Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn
* Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn


## File Descriptions<a name="files"></a>

This project contains three files that you will need to use:

1. finding_donors.ipynb: This is the main file where you will be performing your work on the project.
2. visuals.py: This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the project. Do not modify.
3. census.csv: The project dataset. You'll load this data in the notebook.

The modified census dataset consists of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper *"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid",* by Ron Kohavi. You may find this paper [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf), with the original dataset hosted on [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).

## Instructions<a name="instructions"></a>

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `finding_donors/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
